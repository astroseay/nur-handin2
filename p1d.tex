Next is the Kuiper test. As with the KS test, I am unsure where I went wrong
because I followed the slides but to no avail. With time constraints, 
I was not able to figure it out. Figures are plotted below. One obvious 
explanation is that my distribution does not fit a Gaussian.
I am unsure of potential (and likely) bugs in my code.
