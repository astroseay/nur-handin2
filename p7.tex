The quadtree seen in \autoref{quad} seems to lump too many points in each
node. Again, I ran out of time, though. I was not able to get to printing
the monopoles. I need to search through the specified tree and compute
the multipole for each leaf and then for each tree recursively, as the
problem asks.
