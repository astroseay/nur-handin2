Not much was done here. I understand the the masses are assigned based on the
nearest grid point based on the shapes we are using for the particles, but
I used a poor setup and could not easily assign masses. I would use a mask
to determine where the particles are after iterating through the grid I
created and assign the mass to the closest particle.
