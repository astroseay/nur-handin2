Next is the KS test. For this, I am unsure where I went wrong because
I followed the slides but to no avail. With time constraints, I was not
able to figure it out. Figures are plotted below. One obvious explanation
is that my distribution does not fit a Gaussian. I am unsure of potential
(and likely) bugs in my code.
