\section{Problem 8}
Not implemented. Sad!

Another small rant. I would like it to be known that Computational Astrophysics
is a course based entirely on simulations ($6$ ECs). There were $5$ assignments
that took several weeks to code up---\emph{with} the simulation backbone
already provided (via \texttt{AMUSE}). This problem could probably take a
month to complete on its own. And it is only worth a small fraction of the
final grade. I would love to continue talks on the expectations of this course
in the future.
