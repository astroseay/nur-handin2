\section{Problem 6}

Another unfortunate result. After following the slides and a few YouTube
videos, this is what I was able to come up with: a couple linear regression
models. I had made a bit of a breakthrough in understanding $27/5/2019$,
a bit too late to spend enough time with it to make a nice, working
program though. The ``cost'' estimations (that is, the predicted values)
are not yet yielding what the problem asks for specifically.

However, I will say that I checked for correlations between the parameters
(uncomment the code if you are curious) and I have to note that it is a bit
unfair to give us an assignment wherein we implement logistic regression on
a dataset where the parameters are not even correlated with each other.
Especially given that it is likely none of us have ever implemented machine
learning algorithms before. It makes it that much more difficult to figure out
what to even do.
