\begin{abstract}
 Code output is by part with main functions shown in the beginning.
 As you will see, many parts were either not done or are wrong. 
 My goal is to explain myself as best as possible to maximize points.
 Code is output first, followed by plots and explanations.

\section*{Overview}
 We begin by giving a brief overview of \texttt{handin2.py}. Explanations,
 corrections, etc. will be given in the appropriate problem section. This is
 solely for an overview.
 \lstinputlisting{handin2.py}
First, we see our random number generator (rng). It generates a random number
between 0 and 1. Our integral calculator uses the midpoint method to calculate 
integrals. Our \texttt{normalize\_random\_distribution} method utilizes the
Box-Muller method to generate a Gaussian distribution from a uniform 
distribution. We then define the error function, Gaussian CDF, the 
KS-test and Kuiper test for use in problem 1.
